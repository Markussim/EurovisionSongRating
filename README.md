# EurovisionSongRating

Create your own personal Eurovision song ranking! EurovisionSongRating lets you compare songs head-to-head and builds a scoreboard based on your votes using an ELO rating system.

## How It Works

Compare two songs, vote for your favorite, and watch as their ELO ratings adjust. Over time, this builds a personalized scoreboard reflecting your Eurovision tastes.


## Features
